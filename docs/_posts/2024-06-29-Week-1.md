I started off by going through the FPGA-Robotics repository, and figuring out how to work with tools like Verilator. My goal was to get the examples and tutorials running on my system.

After going through user manuals and guides online, and fixing a few installation snags, I managed to run most of the examples. I found that the documentation could use a few changes, which I am currently working on. Some RTL and SRC files also need a little tweaking in order for new users to get things up and running on their systems.

My next goal is to successfully run the follow_person example on my system, and update the documentation wherever necessary.

### To Do
+ Get the follow_person example running
+ Note the errors faced and their fixes, and update documentation with new build instructions to reflect them
+ Test new build instructions by setting things up on a second system
+ Upload images
