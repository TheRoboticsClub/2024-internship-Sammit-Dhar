After a lot of practice with ROS topic subscribing, processing and publishing, I have succeeded in publishing velocity topics after processing of the \image_raw topic. Also looked into ImGui. 

### To Do
+ Integrate with Imgui
+ Processing as of now is in C++, move processing to Verilator
+ Test new modules and write suitable testbenches
