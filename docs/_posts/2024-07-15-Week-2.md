I went through Verilator documentation and planned how to write my own modules and testbenches. The follow_person example still had some snags. But now the second system is set up properly.

### To Do
+ Get the follow_person example running
+ Documentation will be reviewed all at once at the end
+ Some applications were not running smoothly, change some parameters to address this
